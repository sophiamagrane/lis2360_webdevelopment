        <h1>Music Marketing</h1>
        <h2><em>Understanding how marketing works, throughout the music industry.</em></h2>
        <p> Music marketing is the general activity, it is a way of generating fans and awareness of your music. Marketing is the entire development of your specific artists overall package to attract new listeners and convert them into loyal fans. Behind one well known artist is a team of hard working music marketers that make he/she who they are, by helping those artists find themselves and brand everything they do to fit a certain mold. There are many things that go into marketing an artist or even yourself. </p>
        <p> There are many things you can do in order to get yourself out there, such as uploading your music on Itunes, spotify, or soundcloud. Many local artists usually start small by simply just performing out in order to get recognition. There is a quote, "knowing your fans is the key to success", this meaning, know who listens to your music/who is your audience. You can start by recognizing how old your fan is, what is your fan passionate about, what kind of personality does your fan have, what gender is your fan, and etc. </p>
        <p> Before putting your music on the market you must analyze your market, meaning what musicians are seeing the most success and what are those who are failing doing wrong. By analyzing the market, it will allow you to begin to carve out time in order to perfect your music and work on test runs by playing these singles to people of the random ear, going back to what I said about playing out for recognition. Mainly establishing action is the most important part. By establishing your goals and actions you will need to address your main priorities and who will manage them for you, such as: PR, Advertising, Content, Touring, Social Media, and Networking. </p>
        <p> Mainly stay true to yourself and what you are passionate about in expressing and share those ideas with the world and you will discover people share the same interests. Music Marketing solely used to rely on sending your music and mixtapes to DJ's, radio stations, and journalists, but now it is up to you to choose how you brand yourself. Use the power of social media and YouTube to become this renounced performer and hustle and soon enough you will break the industry.

        <p>&quot; When I got into the music industry, I wasn't focused on being the most famous artist or even getting a major record deal. It was just to make music on my own terms or create my own image, do my own hair, do my own makeup. &quot;</p>
